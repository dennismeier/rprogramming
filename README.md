rprogramming
============

This repository contains files created while taking the Coursea R Programming course offered by John Hopkins University.
This document is my first attempt to write using markdown, which reminds me of HTML but is not HTML. Instead, markdown
seems to be yet another tag-based markup language that somebody thought would be easier to use but probably is not. 

I am following a markdown tutorial as I write, but I need to find another source: the writer has confused *headings* and *headers*, which are two very different document elements. 

Unfortunately, this misuse appears to be endemic to markdown. I am looking at another tutorial that also refers to *headings* as *headers*. Sigh. 

At any rate, headings are created using hash marks--what most of us would call the pound sign: #.

#Heading 1#
##Heading 2##
###Heading 3###
####Heading 4####
#####Heading 5#####
######Heading 6######
